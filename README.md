# ShireReckoning
Calendar system assuming the events of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings appear in our timeline.

There has been a great amount of thought put into the idea that the events of the Lord of the Rings actually takes place on our Earth, very long ago.
There are sites that correlate celestial happenings on our timeline with those of theirs, not to mention that Tolkein himself has stated that the events are on our own timeline.
I've based my calendar on these presumptions.

There are a few different parts to the process of converting one of our dates (in the Gregorian calendar):
Firstly - determine what day of the week it is. This is a very simple conversion
  Monday == Monday
  Tuesday == Trewsday
  Wednesday == Hevensday
  Thursday == Mersday
  Friday == Highday
  Saturday == Sterday
  Sunday == Sunday
Secondly - determine what age we are in. At the moment, we are in the Seventh Age (which started in 1945, the end of WW2). Each age ends after a major war, signaling a new start with a new age.
Thirdly - Determine the actual date and year. This is where the math can get murky.

There are features planned for this app. In its current state it only tells today's date in Shire Reckoning. Future releases plan to have the ability to save dates, perhaps a changing background color based on the date of the year (maybe reflecting colors of the seasons), and maybe even a widget. Of course, I am also open to ideas. Feel free to make a pull request if you'd like to work with the code. If you wish to contribute, that's awesome. I'd live to see what the community can do.

If you wish to use the calculation code for your own purposes, I request that you give credit where it's due. DBAA.
